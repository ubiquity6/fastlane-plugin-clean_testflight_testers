```bash

```

## About clean_testflight_testers

![screenshot.png](screenshot.png)

> Automatically remove TestFlight testers that are not actually testing your app

Just add the following to your `fastlane/Fastfile`

```ruby
# Default setup
lane :clean do
  clean_testflight_testers
end

# This won't delete out inactive testers, but just print them
lane :clean do
  clean_testflight_testers(dry_run: true)
end

# Specify a custom number for what's "inactive"
lane :clean do
  clean_testflight_testers(days_of_inactivity: 120) # 120 days, so about 4 months
end

# Provide custom app identifier / username
lane :clean do
  clean_testflight_testers(username: "apple@krausefx.com", app_identifier: "best.lane"")
end
```

The plugin will remove all testers that either:

- Received a TestFlight email, but didn't accept the invite within the last 30 days
- Installed the app within the last 30 days, but didn't launch it once

Unfortunately the iTunes Connect UI/API doesn't expose the timestamp of the last user session, so we can't really detect the last time someone used the app. The above rules will still help you, remove a big part of inactive testers. 

This plugin could also be smarter, and compare the time stamp of the last build, and compare it with the latest tester activity, feel free to submit a PR for this feature üëç
